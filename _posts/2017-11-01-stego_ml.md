## Steganography and Steganalysis in Images IV

### Machine Learning based Detectors

To deal with LSB matching based methods we need heavy machinery. In this article we will see how to apply [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to steganalysis).

#### 1. Introduction

Machine learning was applied succesfuly to many applications and steganalysis is not an exception. To apply machine learning to steganalysis the first we need is a training database, that is a database of cover and stego images. Second we need a feature extractor, that is a program capable to extract data from the images that could be used to differentiate between cover and stego images. Finally we need a classifier. This classifier receives the features extracted from the cover and stego images and needs to know which images are cover and which images are stego. With this information the classifier will learn how to classify images into cover and stego. This method is not perfect but it can detect LSB matching with high accuracy under laboratory conditions. 


#### 2. Data

We need a database of images to prepare and train our classifier. In the field of steganalysis is very common to use the [Bossbase](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/ImageDB/BOSSbase_1.01.zip), an image set of 10000 grayscale images with size 512x512. So, for this article we are going to use this dataset. Download and uncompress it.


#### 3. Feature extraction

Usually in machine learning with images we need to extract features from the images. These features are multidimensional data that represent some characteristics of the image. Ideally, these characteristics should be different when the images are cover and when they are stego.

During the last years, much research was destinated to find the right way to extract these features. You can find a lot of feature extractors [here](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/feature_extractors/).
