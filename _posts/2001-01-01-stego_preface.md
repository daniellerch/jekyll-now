The prisoners problem was first introduced by G. J. Simmons in 1983 [1] and tells the history of Alice and Bob, two prisoners working on an escape plan. They are allowed to communicate, but their communications pass through the warden, Eve. Eve will attempt to find any hidden communication between Alice and Bob, and if she finds one, she will cut the communication channel. 

The prisoners problem is an example of the need of techniques for sending information in a cover manner. This is frequently used for presenting Data Hiding.

Data hiding is a collection of techniques to embed secret data into digital media such that its existence becomes undetectable. These techniques can be used in many different application scenarios, such as secret communications (Steganography) or copyright protection (Watermarking), among others.
