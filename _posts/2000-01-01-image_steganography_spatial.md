## Practical Image Steganography in the Spatial Domain. 

To hide information in the spatial domain (that is, in the bitmap that represents the image) is usual to modify the least significant bit of some pixels. This technique has evolved significantly over the years, from the now insecure LSB replacement [[1](#references),[2](#references)] to the modern techniques based on adaptive schemes. In this article we will see ...

### Basic information hiding:

Let's suppose that we have the following set of pixels and we want to hide the A letter in ASCII code.
