## Practical Image Steganography in the Spatial Domain. 

To hide information in the spatial domain (that is, in the bitmap that represents the image) is usual to modify the least significant bit of some p√≠xels.

### Basic information hiding:

LSB replacement was a popular technique to hide information inside images in the nineties. To hide information using LSB replacement in one pixel of the image we need to replate its least signigicant bit with the bit of the message we want to hide. 

Let's suppose that we have the following set of pixels and we want to hide the A letter in ASCII code. 

| 01011011 | 10001011 | 00010011 | 00011010 | 00100101 | 11101011 | 11100101 | 01101010 |
